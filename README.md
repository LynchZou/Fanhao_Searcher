## Japanese Animation Searcher version 1.3

**--UPDATE NOTE--**
- Add `A1-Picture` to `Supported Corporations`
- Add `Every Possible Animation` of `A1-Picture` to `Random Search` functionality 
- Optimize algorithm to skip items that have already been searched
- Modified GUI to make it looks better


**--NEXT VERSION**
_(Below are some functionalities that I am trying to accompilsh for next version)_
- List of Animations classified by corporations rather than simply random search
- Present searched items on an online webpage and extend user access
- Add corresponding translations to animation name and staff
- Export to EXEC file (accomplished in version 1.2, but facing a mysterious error now)

Thank you for using!
